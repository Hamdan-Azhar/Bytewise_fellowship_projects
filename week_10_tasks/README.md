# week_10_tasks

An emoji app

## Explanation

In this week, I worked on the features of the favourite page of my emoji app.
The user can add any image to the favourites page just with the help of a 
button and also can delete the images from the favourite page. If there are
no images in the favourites page, the user can upload images with the help
of a button at the center of the page. If there are images already in the
favourite page, then the user can upload and delete images by clicking on 
the upload and delete buttons on the bottom right corner of the app respectively.
All the images are stored in sharedPreferences, so the images are preserved 
even when the user moves from one page to another or restarts the app.

Thus, the emoji app is completed after 10 weeks of work.Here are all the
pages of the app with their explanations.

## Home page

This page contains four emojis each with a different animation.
Also there is a smooth page indicator that indicates the page currently being
accessed. The back and next buttons are used to move between the pages.
