# emoji_app

A simple emoji app 

# Explanation

In this simple app, I have made a bottom navigation bar that displays
contents depending on the buttons clicked by the user. The bottom navigation bar 
consists of four buttons: 'back','next' and two arrow buttons. On clicking any
button, the new contents of the emojiDisplay class are displayed accordingly in 
the center of the screen. Also there is a smoothPageIndicator that indicates the 
current page on the screen. There is also a simple Appbar in the app.
