In this week, I learnt about type of widgets like Stateless and Stateful widgets in flutter and learnt about important widgets used in creating UIs in flutter
like container, SizedBox,stack etc and how to use them to make beautiful user interfaces. In this week task,I have created a single page in which I have used 
DefaultTabController so the user can navigate between tabs.Each tab will have its own content to display when it is clicked by the user. I have divided the entire work
into separate dart files like models.dart for classes and list of objects that contain data and constants.dart that contain colors used in making the page.

To run thes files, make a flutter project with the name "emoji_app" and simply replace the lib folder with this lib folder, test folder with this test folder, pubspec.yaml file with this pubspec.yaml file and add the assets folder containing images to your project. Then run pub get and simply run main.dart to run the app!
